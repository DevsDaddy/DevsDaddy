# Hello, everyone! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ¤” My name is Elijah, I've been working in the game development industry for more than 10 years and I love to solve various problems related to my field.<br>
ðŸ”­ My main tool as a person working with both mobile and console games is of course Unity.<br>
âš¡I also worked with WebGL and used mostly C# or NodeJS as a server language. I would be glad to share my experience - you can always write to me in Discord (SodaBoom).

* General Architecture;

* MMO and Web Games Development;
* Strongly optimization for Android, iOS and WebGL;
* Content Delivery, DevOps, LiveOps;
* Networking;
* Machine Learning;
* Audio and Video Compression;
